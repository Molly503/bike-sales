	•	Order Details: Order date, sales amount, tax, and freight costs.
	•	Sales Territory: Region and country where the sales occurred.

**Tools Used**

	•	Python: Data analysis and visualization (Pandas, Matplotlib).
	•	Excel: Data validation and initial data checks.
	•	SQL: Data extraction and transformation (if needed for database interactions).
	•	Jupyter Notebook: Data exploration and documentation.

**Key Analysis and Findings**

	**1.	Product Category Sales:**

	•	Created a line plot to highlight seasonal and annual fluctuations in bike sales, with peak sales observed towards the end of the year, particularly in December.
 
	**4.	Sales by Country:**
	•	Analyzed total sales by country to understand geographical performance.
	•	Visualized this data in a bar chart, showing that the United States has the highest sales, followed by France and Canada.
 
	**5.	Visualizations:**
	•	Multiple types of visualizations were created to effectively communicate findings, including:
	•	Pie Chart: Distribution of sales across bike categories.
	•	Bar Chart: Accessory sales by subcategory and total sales by country.
	•	Line Plot: Monthly sales trends over the analysis period.

**Key Skills Demonstrated**

	•	Data Wrangling and Cleaning: Filtered data for relevant product categories and formatted date fields for time-series analysis.
	•	Statistical Analysis: Summarized data to calculate total sales by category, monthly trends, and regional performance.
	•	Data Visualization: Used Python’s Matplotlib library to create insightful charts that enhance data interpretation.
	•	Business Insights: Identified high-performing products and seasonal sales patterns, which could support inventory and marketing strategies.

**Conclusion**

This analysis provides valuable insights into bike and accessory sales, helping stakeholders understand which products perform best, how sales vary over time, and which regions contribute most significantly. Such information is crucial for targeted marketing, inventory management, and future growth planning.
